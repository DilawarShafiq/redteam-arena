# RedTeam Arena

> AI vs AI. The ultimate security stress test.

An adversarial AI red team platform where autonomous AI agents attack your systems while defensive AI agents protect them. Fully automated, fully observable, fully terrifying.

## Why?

Every security tool today is reactive. You scan, you patch, you hope. **RedTeam Arena is proactive** — AI agents that think like attackers, probe like hackers, and report like consultants. 24/7. No humans needed.

## What it does

- **Red Agents** autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities  
- **Blue Agents** detect, respond, and adapt defenses in real-time
- **Battle Reports** show exactly what happened, step by step
- **Scenario Engine** — define attack scenarios in plain English
- **Risk Dashboard** — real-time visualization of the battle

## Quick Start

```bash
npx redteam-arena init my-target
npx redteam-arena battle --scenario "insider-threat"
```

## How it works

1. Define your target system and scope
2. Choose attack scenarios (or let AI generate them)
3. Red agents probe, blue agents defend
4. Watch the battle unfold in real-time
5. Get a detailed security report
