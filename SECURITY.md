# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RedTeam Arena itself, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**dilawar.gopang@gmail.com**

Include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Assessment | Within 1 week |
| Fix release | Within 30 days |

## Scope

**In scope:** Vulnerabilities in RedTeam Arena's code — the CLI tool, battle engine, agents, report generation, and scenario loading.

**Out of scope:** Vulnerabilities *found by* RedTeam Arena in your codebase. Those are your responsibility to fix. RedTeam Arena is a security testing tool — findings it produces are not bugs in RedTeam Arena.
