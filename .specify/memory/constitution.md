# Project Constitution: RedTeam Arena

## Project Identity
- **Name**: RedTeam Arena
- **Purpose**: An adversarial AI red team platform where AI agents autonomously attack and defend systems in automated security testing battles.
- **Tagline**: "AI vs AI. The ultimate security stress test."

## Core Principles
1. **Security-first**: Everything we build must be safe and sandboxed
2. **Agent-agnostic**: Works with any LLM provider
3. **Observable**: Every attack and defense is recorded and replayable
4. **Educational**: Helps teams understand real threat vectors
5. **Open-source**: Community-driven, MIT licensed
